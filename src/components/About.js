          <p id="aboutp">Hey! Thanks for checking out my portfolio! My name&apos;s Thomas/Tom/Tommy. I&apos;ve been learning to code from Southend in Essex, which is an easy commute into London.</p>
          <p id="aboutp">As someone driven by creativity and purpose, my enthusiasm for coding stems from the fulfilment of witnessing my creations take shape. I&apos;ve always enjoyed learning new skills and finding creative solutions to intricate puzzles in my writing and music, so I soon found myself transitioning careers as a result of my growing fascination. </p>
          <p id="aboutp2">I then enrolled into General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering course to further my knowledge at a rapid pace and gain quantifiable experience. Now, I&apos;m a former laboratory technician who is driven, passionate and eager to learn as much about software engineering as possible. I can&apos;t wait to become a member of a collaborative team and infuse my own imaginative code into compelling projects.

          <img id="music" src={music}></img>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <p id="aboutp">Some of my favourite artists include The Doors, The Clash, Nas, A Tribe Called Quest, Metallica, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash and Frank Sinatra.   </p>
          <p id="aboutp">I enjoy a huge variety of music and I love to play classical guitar. I particularly enjoy reinterpeting songs into my own arrangements, as well as writing my own original music and occasionally posting it to social media.</p>
          <p id="aboutp">I love the expression of creativity, the journey of mastering a particular musical phrase, the problem solving it entails and the meditative state my mind is in whilst playing.</p>
          <h2 id="hobbies2">Sport</h2>
          <img id="ball" src={ball}></img>
          <p id="aboutp">I&apos;ve spent much of my life playing sports and I still enjoy working out and being active. Running is something I particularly enjoy because it helps clear my mind and provides me with ample time to reflect. Some of my favourite sports include football, basketball and skateboarding. Although <strong>&quot;technically&quot;</strong> not a sport, I&apos;m also a lifelong wrestling fan.</p>
